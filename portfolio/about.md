I am a new grad student from UBC. I completed my degree in Computer Science December of 2018. Before entering computer science, I was a bit lost and was not sure what I am passionate about and what career is right for me. I went back and forth between choosing a career in Medicine and Civil Engineering. However, it was around the end of my first year at UBC when I realized what I am truly passionate about. I had to take Introduction to Computation in Engineering as part of the mandatory courses for first-year engineering. This course was by far my most challenging course at the time since I had no previous knowledge of programming and software development. As the result, I put in my best effort and went above and beyond to learn everything offered by this course. Eventually, as I gained more knowledge about this field, I was more fascinated, excited and eager to learn even more, so I decided to study computer science.

Recently, I completed an eight-month coop as a software engineering at Electronic Arts, working as part of the FIFA Core Online team. 

<!-- My duties was to build console applications for tools used internally and externally. Some of the tools I built include smoke test automation, automated environment configuration and extracting data from a clientâ€™s file plan. I experienced how software development works on a larger scale, the agile process and learned to program in c#.

Outside of school, I enjoy attending hackathons where I can meet new people and start building solutions to problems in a short amount of time. Hackathons encourage everyone to try new things and help one another. This year, I took on a new volunteer position as a Microsoft student partner at UBC. I hope my team and I will be able to hold some meaningful and fun events for the students and encourage more people to build amazing software with the free tools that Microsoft offers.

After completing my degree next May, I hope to either find a software developer job where I am able to combine health care and technology or start a consulting company.
