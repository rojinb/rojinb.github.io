# Why Computer Science?
I am a new grad student from UBC. I completed my degree in Computer Science December of 2018. Before starting this major, I was a bit lost and was not sure what I am passionate about and what career is right for me. I went back and forth between choosing a career in Medicine and Civil Engineering. However, it was around the end of my first year at UBC when I realized what I am truly passionate about. I had to take Introduction to Computation in Engineering as part of the mandatory courses for first-year engineering. This course was by far my most challenging course at the time since I had no previous knowledge of programming and software development. As the result, I put in my best effort and went above and beyond to learn everything offered by this course. Eventually, as I gained more knowledge about this field, I was more fascinated, excited and eager to learn even more, so I decided to study computer science.

# Main interests in Computer Science
My interests and coursework during my academic career have been mostly focused in two main areas of:  
1) low-level programming in C, OS, and optimization  
2) Machine Learning, data mining, and AI.  
However, both my co-op work experiences have been mostly focused on the first part. Nevertheless, I am very eager and aim to strengthen my work experience in the second field. The amount of possibilities and knowledge gain from this field is absolutely thrilling for me, and I cannot wait to begin a career in such a field and use my knowledge to discover more fascinating solutions. 

# My coop experience at EA

Recently, I completed an eight-month coop as a software engineer at Electronic Arts, working as part of the FIFA Online team. As part of my work, I would daily monitor bug reports found in automation and manual testing. Then I read and analyzed logs, and created and fixed automation scripts. This all helped me to better learn how to triage Automation Issues and fix them. I also worked closely with the design team to implement and update the front-end of the game. This included a few reskinning tasks and front-end issues on the online game screens. As my latest task, I learned more about memory management in the game and was able to implement dynamic loading/unloading of the customized fonts upon request to save memory.

When I started my Co-op at EA, my goal was, of course, to develop my coding skills and learn about as many different areas of software and game development as possible given the opportunity. By the end, I had improved my C++ and python skills, and I also learned C# and Action Scripts. However, my goal was not limited to developing my technical skills. Working in such a big company and with many teams all working on FIFA, my other goal was to improve both my email and in-person communication skills and learn how I can connect with others to advance on a project which is dependent on several teams. Fortunately, I was given just the right task to improve these skills. This was a text rendering issue on certain screens and
there were several projects involved in rendering these screens, so I had to start communicating with other teams to resolve this issue. At first, it was very difficult for me to try to help them understand the issue FIFA was experiencing and to get their help. Nevertheless, I started to learn how I could provide help, ask for help, and hold people responsible to find a solution to solve the issue.

# Main interests and hobbies outside of computer science
I have been a member of Champions Martial Arts School for about 10 years. A few years ago I tested for my black belt in kickboxing and now besides training there, I also occasionaly teach the cardio kickboxing class.  
Additionally, I'm a big fan of hiking and skiing. Exploring new trails, seeing a new scenery, discovering a remote lake, and immersing myself in nature are all very exciting for me.

I also enjoy reading and learning about medical advances, new psycholagical findings, and economical trends.
